## Dataset:
Gained access to stakeholders accounts to download paystubs and transaction statements. Check out my [raw data](https://github.com/schmiedel1992/Capstone-Case-Study-Projects/tree/main/Case%20Study%203:%20Home%20Finances%20Analysis/Data).

## Excel: 
I downloaded, updated, cleaned and corrected data in CSV and XLSX files. Combining transaction data into a single workbook. Check out my [Excel](https://github.com/schmiedel1992/Capstone-Case-Study-Projects/tree/main/Case%20Study%203%3A%20Home%20Finances%20Analysis/Microsoft%20Results) results for a detailed account of my process.

## R:
I imported the data. Made columns consistent and merged them into a single dataframe. Then I cleaned up and added data to prepare for analysis. Conducted a descriptive analysis and exported a summary file for stakeholder deliverables. Check out my [R](https://github.com/schmiedel1992/Capstone-Case-Study-Projects/tree/main/Case%20Study%203%3A%20Home%20Finances%20Analysis/R%20Results) results for a detailed account of my process.

## Tableau:
I created a data visualization using Tableau. I focused my data viz on answering every possible question that branches from the initial stakeholder question: "How can I save money and pay off my debt?" Check out my [Tableau](https://github.com/schmiedel1992/Capstone-Case-Study-Projects/tree/main/Case%20Study%203%3A%20Home%20Finances%20Analysis/Tableau%20Results) results for a detailed account of my process.
