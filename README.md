# Data set information
* Cyclistic's historical trip data, based on the last annual cycle from April 2023 to March 2024. Motivate International Inc. has made the data available under this [License](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

## Excel: 
I cleaned the data, added and deleted columns, and combined to one workbook. Most of the 12 sheets, totaling over 1 GB of data, had a high amounts of missing data, that we deleted per stakeholders guidelines. Check out my Excel Results for a detailed account of my process.

## SQL: 
I cleaned the data, documented the total number of rows, distinct values, minimum, maximum, and mean values of "ride_length" and "day_of_week" per sheet, and much more, then applied all 12 sheets together. I used JOIN statements to combine stakeholder-relevant data into one table. Created summary statistics, investigated trends purely based on data-driven information, and saved that information into a table. Check out my SQL Results for a detailed analysis.

## R:
I imported the data. Made columns consistent and merged them into a single dataframe. Then I cleaned up and added data to prepare for analysis. Conducted a descriptive analysis and exported a summary file for stakeholder deliverables. 

## Tableau:
I created a data visualization using Tableau. I focused my data viz on answering every possible question that branches from the initial stakeholder question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" I also linked my Rmd findings on my Tableau page at the bottom.
